# createInstanceByTime


## Description
Create a new instance based on the source instance backup, and recover the data of the new instance to the same status as the data at the specified time point of the source instance by adding new logs. <br>For example, creating an instance B at the time point '2018-06-18 23:00:00' based on instance A means creating an instance B, of which the data is exactly the same as the data of instance A at the time point '2018-06-18 23:00:00'. <br>For the SQL Server, recovery/creation by time point is not supported within 30 minutes after the primary/backup switchover. For example, if the user performs the primary/backup switchover at 10:05, recovery/creation by time point is unavailable during the time period from 10:05 to 10:35. <br>- only support MySQL
