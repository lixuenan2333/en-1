|Interface name|Request mehod|Function description|
|---|---|---|
|**associateElasticIp**|POST|The elastic IP associated with the container is the elastic IP corresponding to the primary network interface and primary private IP.</br>One virtual machine only can be associated with one elastic IP (primary network interface). If the primary network interface has the elastic IP, the error will be returned. <br></br>If the user is in the blacklist, the error will be returned.</br>|
|**createContainers**|POST|Create configuration containers for one or more sets</br>\- Real\-name verification is required for creating containers</br>\- Image</br>    \- Determine the container image via the image name</br>    \- Images named as nginx:tag or mysql/mysql\-server:tag are the public images of docker hub</br>    \- Images named as container\-registry/image:tag are the images of private registry</br>    \- The private registry must be compatible to the docker registry verification mechanism and save confidential information via secret.</br>\- Hostname Specification</br>    \- Two modes are supported: Write through a tab mode or write through a complete machine name mode.</br>    \- Tag Specification</br>        \- 0\-9, a\-z (both upper case and lower case are acceptable) and \- (minus), others are deemed as invalid character string</br>        \- Neither start with a minus nor end with a minus.</br>        \- At least 1 character and at most 63 characters</br>    \- A complete machine name consists of a series of tabs and dots</br>        \- Tags are connected with “.” (dots)</br>        \- Neither start with a “.” (dot) or end with a “.” (dot).</br>        \- Complete machine name (including tags and dots “.”) with at most 63 ASCII characters</br>\- Network Configuration</br>    \- Specify primary network interface configuration information</br>        \- Be sure to specify one subnet</br>        \- A security group must be specified when creating a virtual machine and at most 5 security groups can be specified.</br>        \- The elastic IP can be restricted by specifying elasticIp specification, with the bandwidth value range of [1\-200]Mbps and the stepping of 1Mbps.</br>        \- The primaryIpAddress of network interface can be specified; such IP shall be within the subnet IP range and shall not be occupied; and maxCount can only be 1 when specifying subnet IP.</br>        \- The securityGroup and the Subnet shall be in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).</br>        \- Set deviceIndex of primary network interface to be 1</br>\- Storage</br>    \- The volume can be divided into a root volume and a data volume; the root volume is mounted with the catalog /; and the data volume is mounted with any specified catalog.</br>    \- The bottom storage medium of the volume only supports the cloud type, i.e. the Cloud Disk Service.</br>    \- System Disk</br>        \- The available Cloud Disk Service types include ssd and premium\-hdd.</br>        \- Disk Size</br>            \- SSD: Range [10, 100]GB, Step Size: 10G</br>            \- Premium\-hdd: Range [20, 1000]GB, Step Size: 10G</br>        \- Automatic Deletion</br>            \- The cloud disk will be automatically deleted with the container by default. For the data disk or the shared type data disk with the monthly package, the parameter is invalid.</br>        \- The existing Cloud Disk Service can be selected.</br>    \- Data Disk</br>        \- The available Cloud Disk Service types include ssd and premium\-hdd.</br>        \- Disk Size</br>            \- SSD: Range [20, 1000]GB, Step Size: 10G</br>            \- Premium\-hdd: Range [20, 3000]GB, Step Size: 10G</br>        \- Automatic Deletion</br>            \- Automatic Deletion by Default</br>        \- The existing Cloud Disk Service can be selected.</br>        \- A single container can be mounted with 7 data volumes at most.</br>\- Billing</br>  \- Elastic IP billing mode: If the separate setting of Pay By Consumption is selected, other billing modes shall be subject to the machine.</br>  \- The billing mode of Cloud Disk Service is subject to the machine.</br>\- Container Log</br>    \- A 10MB storage space will be distributed to the local by default and is automatically rotated.</br>\- Others</br>    \- After being created, the container is in running status.</br>    \- maxCount refers to the maximum effort and the maxCount is not guaranteed.</br>|
|**createSecret**|POST|Create a secret for storing relevant confidential information of image registry.</br>|
|**deleteContainer**|DELETE|The container must have the status of stopped, running or error. <br></br>The instance paid by volume will keep running until it is deleted. The instance not used anymore can be passively stopped through this interface. <br></br>Only the instance with the billing type by volume can be passively deleted. The container with monthly package expired can also be deleted. Please report to the ticket system for other situations. The container with billing status exception can’t be deleted.</br>|
|**deleteSecret**|DELETE|Delete a single secrete</br>|
|**describeContainer**|GET|Search details of one Native Container</br>|
|**describeContainers**|GET|Search Native Container details in batches <br></br>This interface supports query in pages, with 20 entries per page by default.</br>|
|**describeQuota**|GET|Search resource quota and support Native Container and secret.</br>|
|**describeSecret**|GET|Search details of a single secrete</br>|
|**describeSecrets**|GET|Search secret list. <br> </br>This interface supports query in pages, with 20 entries per page by default.</br>|
|**disassociateElasticIp**|POST|The EIP disassociated with the container is the elastic IP corresponding to the primary network interface and primary private IP.</br>|
|**getLogs**|GET|Search a container log</br>|
|**modifyContainerAttribute**|PATCH|Modify the container name and description.</br>|
|**startContainer**|POST|Start a single container in the off status and the container involved a job can’t be started. <br></br>When the container instance or a cloud disk associated is defaulting, the container will not be normally started. <br></br>|
|**stopContainer**|POST|Stop a single instance in the operating status and the container involved in a job can’t be started.</br>|
