        -   Create one or more Cloud Disks that are paid by configuration or by service time.
        -   Disk type includes Premium Hdd Cloud Disk and SSD Cloud Disk.
        -   The billing method defaults to paying by configuration.
        -   After creation is completed, the status of the Cloud Disk is available.
        -   The optional parameter snapshot ID is used to create a new disk.
        -   In batch creation, the name of the Cloud Disk is: hard disk name -number, such as myDisk-1 and myDisk-2.
        -   maxCount is the maximum effort, and it is not guaranteed that maxCount can be reached.
